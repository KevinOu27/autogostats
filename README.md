# Project Title: Automated Go for Statistics

This project tests using Golang for statistics with linear regression using the Anscombe Quartet Data with automated programming 

## Files

- 'regression.py': Python script for linear regression analysis with execution time
- 'regression.R': R script for linear regression analysis with execution time
- 'aigostats.go': ChatGPT-generated Go script for linear regression analysis
- 'aiigostats_test.go': ChatGPT-generated Go script for testing and benchmarking of gostats.go

## Setup and Run (Ensure in correct directory)

### Go 
'go run gostats.go' to run go script for linear regression
'go test -v' to test the linear regression script and give execution time
'go test -bench=.' to give benchmarks on Go scriptExe

### Python

Within terminal of the directory of gostats, ensure python environment is up to date and numpy and scipy are installed
This can be done with 
'python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install numpy scipy' to ensure the environment we are working in is able to install/run numpy and scipy

'python3 regression.py' to run the python script in repository 

### R 
'Rscript regression.r' to run the R script in repository

### Experinces with Automated programming for Go for Statistics

Automated Code Generation: https://go.dev/blog/generate

Tried to use go generate to generate some unit tests, installed gotests in order to add the code generation comment to be able to run it in terminal with ‘go generate’
This was a little difficult to understand and incorporate
Instructions: added '//go:generate gotests -w -all auto_regression_test.go' to code with functions

AI-assisted programming: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview

Installed github copilot in my IDE and did not see how it could help with my previous code, it had added a TODO to add test cases but did not add them as advertised on the extensions page. I was unable to observe any changes that Github Copilot would suggest but maybe that is because I am working on the code that was already finished. I can see that it would help immensely to automatically fill in statistical functions like the linear regression testing that we are using in this assignment. 

AI-generated code: https://chatgpt.com/

The code generated by ChatGPT for the unit testing is not very valid, it does not remember the previous code snippets that it has given me and continues to give me errors for the unit testing portion of the code. The regular Go code to parse the data from a csv file took a couple of attempts of conversation but it works well and gives the intended result from running it. 


I believe that the AI-generated code worked the best as the other methods seemed a little more difficult to use. I believe that maybe using a paid/more premium version of AI-generation for the code could produce better results that would be actually usable for all aspects, but the free version did produce good Go code for the actual statistical function that runs the linear regression on a data set.
